[2012-11-23] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (121570ca6ffc):
- Some quick changes to make the IRCd report as version 4.0-dev

[2012-11-23] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (a3ff98018fe2):
- Update ./createchangelog to make it only show changes on unreal34 branch.

[2012-11-24] Bram Matthys <syzop@vulnscan.org> (b1f7508d5cf4):
- test commit

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (fe14e8022279):
- Add support for proper FD accounting (rewrite of the fdlist code).
  This is the first step to adding evented I/O.  Infact, writing the evented I/O code
  should now be quite easy.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (086a1c63bacc):
- First cut at new evented I/O system.  Right now, we only implement support for poll(2).
  Nothing is hooked up to it yet, I will cover that in the next few commits.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (dc97ac360189):
- Give IO event subscribers information on whether or not they are getting read or write events,
  or both.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (d1282bb38d03):
- Assume all poll notification requests should persist, and that the caller will
  deregister interest itself when it is done polling.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (7cb4f6575aef):
- Port DNS resolver to run under new evented I/O system.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (cdf46bd17f36):
- Disconnect identd checking code from monolithic I/O system and port it to
  the evented I/O system.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (a6dd4b4756d9):
- Do not invalidate data pointer in FD entry table, unless events are oneshot.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (fa839b4ded6a):
- Disconnect client packet handling (non-SSL) and listener handling from read_message().
  With this change, it is possible to completely disconnect read_message() from the mainloop,
  and have a fairly responsive ircd (noticably more responsive than what we had before I
  started on this).
  The "fakelag" stuff has been replaced with charybdis's deferred command processing logic,
  which is more efficient and does the same thing without punishing behaving clients.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (7c22fc01cd1f):
- Remove remaining listener-related deritius from read_message().

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (d98c54862943):
- Clean up locking in the identd/dns checking subsystem.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (f480d82a80d2):
- Fix a socket event leak in the new resolver code by assuming requests that
  are neither read nor write means that c-ares is no longer interested in the
  socket.  Thusly we unregister it.  This is probably wrong, but it seems to
  work fine.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (e67cd8f4c08d):
- Call fd_refresh() when closing an FD.  This way events may be dequeued from the event system.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (2aea9beeac0d):
- Add support for oneshot I/O handlers.

[2012-10-26] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (a1a66929aaf9):
- Add support for tracking backend state for FD table entries.

[2012-10-26] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (185dfb055349):
- Add a polling backend that uses epoll(2).

[2012-10-26] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (a33b3bbcbcbe):
- Add eventloop implementation for select(2).

[2012-10-26] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (b327e12c0be6):
- Add untested kqueue(2) backend.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (964180413a2d):
- Fix autoconn with evented i/o loop.

[2012-10-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (640c9e64e10f):
- Port the SSL code over to the evented I/O subsystem.

[2012-10-08] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (5f78a1301919):
- Remove IsBlocked()/SetBlocked()/ClearBlocked() and related deritius.

[2012-10-26] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (1e4d303880b4):
- Removed broken VMS netwrite() code.

[2012-11-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (d9b8a41682d7):
- Simplify deliver_it().

[2012-10-25] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (bb420f799724):
- Hook up remote includes code into the new event loop, and remove references to
  url_do_transfers_async() which has been removed.

[2012-10-26] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (426d0b157103):
- Kill read_message() and related deritius with fire.
  The dreamforge event-loop is now fully exorcized from the codebase.

[2012-11-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (656ae9c53ff7):
- Kill busycli_fdlist with fire.

[2012-11-05] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (a206abce0250):
- Exorcize HTM (heavy traffic mode) from Unreal.
  This is partially for the sake of Stskeeps, even though he left the
  project long ago, but mainly so we can work towards dynamic ticks in
  the event loop while guaranteeing latencies for connected clients,
  even with fakelag.

[2012-11-12] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (e04b741feef2):
- Remove nextping, nextconnect, nextblah stuff.  Use proper events instead.

[2012-11-19] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (82e7eb60b6b1):
- Remove flush_connections().  It is now obsolete via the async i/o.
  As a result of removing this, Unreal's CPU usage is reduced by 45% with
  10000 local connections.

[2012-11-21] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (ff8003973c40):
- Replace calls to strncpyzt() macro with more secure strlcpy().
  This was done using Coccinelle, the semantic patch was:

  @@
  expression src, dst, len;
  @@

  - strncpyzt(src, dst, len);
  + strlcpy(src, dst, len);

[2012-11-21] William Pitcock <nenolod@dereferenced.org> (4c75deccc73f):
- StrEq() macro has no users, so we can remove this too.
